# Belly_Button_BioDiversity

## Project Objective:
In this project, I built an interactive dashboard which will be used to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. 
The data used are pulled from 10 participants, in which we catalogue the microbes that are present in their belly button.
We are interested in finding the top 10 bacteria that resides in each subject. 

I used JavaSCript, Plotly, and D3.js in order to create a dashboard that would presents bacterial data which is based on unique bacteria ID.
This interactive charts help us visualize the various types of bacteria that was taken from the volunteer participants. 
Javascript functions and methods that were required: 
1. map()
2. filter()
3. reverse()
4. slice() 

I created a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart and a gauge chart in order to provide even more information.
This chart allows for people to create any layout that they would like for their dashboard.
